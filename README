Bitlyit is a PHP function and javascript example of how to create a bitly short URL from jQuery ajax.

Originally uploaded for a tutorial on my blog. 

To use:
1) Checkout this repo into your web root
2) Open ajax_bitly.php and enter your bit.ly username and API key on line 25. If you don't have a username/key yet, get one here: http://bit.ly/a/your_api_key
3) Open bitlyit_demo.html in a browser window.
4) Enter a URL into the input box and click "Shorten this URL!". Be sure you include http:// in your URL or it will fail.
5) Hooray!

Use at your own risk, but feel free to send me a message if you have any questions or issues:
